  <h3>Website Mirrors.</h3>
  -------------------------------------<br>
  <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b><br>
  <b>Q: What is a Website Mirror?</b><br>
    A: Website Mirror, Mirror of a Website, or shortly Mirror, is a Copy of the Website, 
	located at various Places. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: What is Mirror used for?</b><br>
    A: Mirrors are used to ensure that if one Web-Host accidentally goes offline or dis-appears, 
	the other Mirrors will continue to function, making the Site reachable for Visitors.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: Does this Site have Mirrors?</b><br>
    A: To make Information available 24 Hours per Day and 365 Days per Year, it is planned 
	that this Website should have one or several Mirrors across the global Internet Computer Network. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: Are all the Mirrors the same?</b><br>
	A: When possible, the Mirrors are made equal to each other. But when it is not possible 
	(due to different Rules and Restrictions of Web Hosting Services), some Parts of the 
	Information on the Website may be un-available. While the main Purpose of this Project 
	is to save Information about all the Files and binary Images of the Media, the minimum 
	Set of Information should be available on all the Mirrors without any Exception from this Rule. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: What is the minimum Set of Information?</b><br>
	A: The minimum Set of Information includes all the Hash Sums of all Files and all the 
	Hash Sums of Media Images, both in at least two types of Representation: 
	in Text Files (TXT) and compressed into Archives of ZIP Type. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: How can I open these Text Files and Archives?</b><br>
    A: To provide Read-ability for all Users across the Planet, it was decided that the Text Files 
	containing useful Information must be written in Unicode UTF-8 Format instead of old ANSI 
	Format. Today, even in MSDOS Operating System, there are Tools that are able to view UTF-8 
	encoded Text Files. The first Version of Unicode appeared in the Year 1991. <br>
	<br>
	ZIP Type of Archives is one of the oldest (among presently being used) Formats of Archives. 
	ZIP Type is not the safest and not the most efficient Type of Compression, but it is proudly 
	one of the most accessible. ZIP Archives use an Algorithm named Deflate. Deflate is a 
	lossless Compression Method, combining Huffman Code and LZ77 Algorithm. Deflate Algorithm is 
	known to be free from all the existing Patents, this means that using it you do not infringe 
	any existing Patent, you do not break any Rule or Law. <br>
	<br>
	The Question of the Archive Type Choice will be described in one of the Articles on this Site.
