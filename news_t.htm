    Month December of the Year 2015 was the Month when the first Versions of this Website began to appear. 
    At first they were quite simple and contained very little Information. 
    As Time passed by the Pages grew in Size and so did the Number of the Pages on the Site. <br>
    <br>
    Till the End of December the Website gained Pages for such Games as Fallout, Fallout 2, 
    Heroes of Might and Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic II, Heroes of Might and Magic III and 
    Heroes Chronicles Series. New interesting good old Stuff is comming soon.
