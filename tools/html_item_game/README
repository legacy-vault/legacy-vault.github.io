DESCRIPTION

"html_item_game" is a simple tool which helps to fast create HTML files for the 
project called "Legacy Vault". At one run this tool creates two pages in 
different formats about games. The formats are: text format and graphic format.

folder (second parameter in command line) is set properly!
