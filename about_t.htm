  <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b><br>
  
  <b>Q: What is this Place?</b><br>
	A: This Website is a Place to store old, outdated or, some times even, ancient Things, 
	found around the World. This Website does not store exact Copies of Materials, due 
	to modern juridical Restrictions, but istead, it tries to provide a Method to preserve 
	old Things from Extinction. To say it more detailed, this Website stores Information, 
	that may be useful to check Disk Images's Integrity and Completeness.
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <b>Q: Which Categories of Materials can I find here?</b><br>
    A: On this Resource you can find Information about various ancient Games, Music, Audio Books, 
	Computer Programs and other Stuff.
   <br>
   <br>
   
	<b>Q: Why does it look so odd and old-fashioned?</b><br>
    A: As you can see, this Site deals with old rusty Junk. To make it accessible to old Computers, 
	this Site has been made using old Standards and Methods. Most of the Pages are made mostly 
	of Text and are written in old HTML 3.2 Standard without heavy Scripts and Images. Pages 
	of this Website may be easily seen at Screen Resolutions of 640x480 and better.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: What exactly can I find here, on this Website?</b><br>
    A: This Website stores Information about binary Images of Disks and Files, which these Disks 
	contain. This Information includes: Size (in Bytes) of File, Date and Time of File's Last 
	Modification, List of all Files in Disk, Hash Sums of all Files and binary Image.
	<br>
	<br>
	
   <b>Q: How do you do it?</b><br>
    A: The Hash Sums are calculated using such Algorithms as AICH, BTIH, CRC32, ED2K, EDON-R 256, 
	EDON-R 512, GOST R 34.11-94, HAS-160, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, 
	SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SNEFRU-128, SNEFRU-256, Tiger, DC++ TTH and Whirlpool. 
	In order to make things fair and safe, all the Check Sums are calculated in Open-Source 
	Operating System of the Linux Series using the RHash Utility. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Q: What is all this for?</b><br>
    A: Hash Sums are used to ensure and verify Integrity of large Volumes of Data for a long-term 
	storing or transferring. It would be sad to store a Disk for 20 Years and suddenly discover 
	a Scratch on it or a Damage resulting in Data Loss. For such Cases, we provide Information 
	to check Disk's Integrity and Absence of Errors. To make Recovery of lost Data we recommend 
	using distributed storing Methods, which may be brought by modern File sharing Programs and 
	Help of the global Internet Computer Network.

	<b>Q: Why is all written in English Language at this Site?</b><br>
    A: At present Time, English Language is an international Language on Planet Earth. 
	To make Information available to as many People as possible, we are using an 
	international Dialect. Modern Websites nowadays offer quite good online Translation 
	Services. So, Translation from modern English to your Language is very easy today.
	<br>
	<br>
	
    <b>Q: Why are you using capital Letters in Words?</b><br>
	A: It may seem strange at first, but this is also a Type of History Preservation. 
	The History shows that Old English Language was formed with the Help of Influence 
	from Celtic Languages and North Germanic Languages. All the Nouns in German Language 
	are written in such Way, that the first Letter in a Noun is always capital (big). 
	The Creators of this Website find this Feature very practical and comfortable to read.
