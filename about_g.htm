	This Website is a Place to store old, outdated or, some times even, ancient Things, 
	found around the World. This Website does not store exact Copies of Materials, due 
	to modern juridical Restrictions, but istead, it tries to provide a Method to preserve 
	old Things from Extinction. To say it more detailed, this Website stores Information, 
	that may be useful to check Disk Images's Integrity and Completeness.

	Hash Sums are used to ensure and verify Integrity of large Volumes of Data for a long-term 
	storing or transferring. It would be sad to store a Disk for 20 Years and suddenly discover 
	a Scratch on it or a Damage resulting in Data Loss. For such Cases, we provide Information 
	to check Disk's Integrity and Absence of Errors. To make Recovery of lost Data we recommend 
	using distributed storing Methods, which may be brought by modern File sharing Programs and 
	Help of the global Internet Computer Network.

	It may seem strange at first, but this is also a Type of History Preservation. 
	The History shows that Old English Language was formed with the Help of Influence 
	from Celtic Languages and North Germanic Languages. All the Nouns in German Language 
	are written in such Way, that the first Letter in a Noun is always capital (big). 
	The Creators of this Website find this Feature very practical and comfortable to read.
