	<br>
    <br>
    
	<b>Floppy Disk.</b><br>
	A Floppy Disk, a Diskette, or just a Floppy, is a Type of Disk Storage composed of a Disk of thin 
	and flexible magnetic Storage Medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic Carrier lined with fabric that 
	removes Dust Particles. Floppy Disks are read and written by a Floppy Disk Drive (FDD). 
	Floppy Disks, initially as 8-Inch (8.0", 200 mm) Media and later in 5¼-Inch (5.25", 133 mm) 
	and 3½-Inch (3.5", 90 mm) Sizes, were a ubiquitous Form of Data Storage and Exchange from the Middle of 
	1970s well into the 2000s. First 8.0" Diskettes were commercially available in Year 1971. 
	Diskettes of the most popular 3.5" HD Format used 1.2 µm (1200 nm) cobalt-doped iron oxide. <br>
	
	<br>
	By the Year 2010, Computer Motherboards are rarely manufactured with Floppy 
	Drive Support; 3½-inch (3.5") Floppy Disks can be used with an external USB Floppy Disk Drive (USB FDD), 
	but USB Drives for 5¼-Inch (5.25"), 8-Inch (8.0"), and non-standard Diskettes are rare to non-existent. 
	These Formats are usually handled by older Equipment. While Floppy Disk Drives still have some limited Uses, 
	especially with legacy industrial Computer Equipment, they have been superseded by Data Storage Methods 
	with much greater Capacity, such as USB Flash Sticks, Flash Storage Cards, portable external Hard Disk Drives (HDD), 
	Optical Discs (OD), and Computer Networks. One of the latest Models of the Motherboards that have FDD Connector 
	on the Board is an ASRock 980DE3/U3S3 (it supports Socket AM3+ AMD's CPUs with TDP up to 140W, 4 Modules of 
	DDRIII DIMM SDRAM, 6x SATA2 and 2x SATA3, 4x PCI Express 2.0, 3x USB2.0 and 1x USB3.0, 2x PS/2, 1x COM, 1x ATA133 IDE, 
	1x Floppy and good old 16 MB AMI Legal BIOS).<br>
	
	<br>
	The latest and most popular Format of Diskettes was 
	introduced in the Year 1987 and it was a 3½-Inch (3.5") HD Format with the Formatted Storage Capacity 
	of 1440 kB (2880 Sectors of 512 Bytes each) and 1.44 MB as marked Capacity. "HD" in the Name means 
	High Density. In the Year 1999 Sony Corporation introduced the 3½-Inch (3.5") HiFD Format, having the 
	Formatted Storage Capacity of 150/200 MB. This Format was backward compatible with existing 3.5" 
	Floppies (old Devices could use it as a 1.44 MB Disk). By the strange historical Reasons, all the 
	Improvements of the Floppy-sized Formats have not become popular in the World.
