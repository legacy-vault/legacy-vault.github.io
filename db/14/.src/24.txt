Seven weeks have passed since we set sail from Enroth. 
Slaves freed from our skirmishes with regnant fleets talk of the turmoil 
in Erathia. I suspect their stories are true, but I must see the evidence with 
my own eyes. The ocean tides were kind enough to bury the fallen on their 
shores, however, the smoking ruins of Cloudfire greeted us with nothing but 
destruction and the stench of death. With no survivors, only the battlefield 
could tell me what happened here. Despite the breadth of devastation, the 
presence of Minotaurs suggests a raiding party, however the ranks were too well 
organized. This is the work of the Dungeon Overlords! Evidently the wizards 
were prepared, but overrun nevertheless. These atrocities rend my heart and 
fuel my anger. Erathia's banner must be respected, never disgraced. I think of 
my beloved Roland, and my son Nikolai, and how much further this war will take 
me from them. But my duty is clear. My father's kingdom must survive. Erathia 
must not fall to its enemies!
