To install and run the Game in DOSBox, use mounting from inside the DOSBox, not via external Tools! 
Mounting a Daemon Tools's virtual Drive to DOSBox hanges the Emulator. 
To mount the CD Disk use DOSBox command "imgmount". <br>
<br>
Example: <br>
imgmount d "path_to_iso_file/abc.iso" -t iso<br>
In Installator it is better to select SoundBlaster compatible Card (if you have it). Has been tested on Audigy 4 successfully.
