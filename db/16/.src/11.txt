Heroes Chronicles is a Series of Turn-based Strategy Video Games 
developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and 
published by The 3DO Company. Each Installment of Chronicles was 
released as an Episode containing a relatively short single-player 
Campaign with a relatively low Difficulty Level. All Chronicles 
Games are based on a limited Version of the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III Game Engine. The Ability to play Scenario Maps and 
Multiplayer Games is not included in any Chronicles Title. 
Each Game (or Chapter) consists of a single Campaign recounting 
an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
Each Campaing is devoted to one Race of the Creatures of the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III Fanatasy Universe. <br>

<br>
First Chapter -- Warlords of the Wasteland -- is devoted to 
Stronghold Game Race. <br>

<br>
Warlords is billed as a "Prequel", telling the Story of Tarnum's 
Quest to lead his Barbarian Peoples to throw off the oppressive 
Rule of Bracaduun and the Wizards who are his Masters. However, 
as the Intro gives away, while Tarnum will become King, in doing 
so he will commit Crimes that cause the Ancestors to refuse his 
Admission to Paradise, and he will be returned as the immortal 
Hero of the next Episode (Conquest of the Underworld). <br>

<br>
The Campaign consists of eight Scenarios, with Tarnum carrying his 
Experience forward from Scenario to Scenario. The Game plays exactly 
like Heroes III: Shadow of Death (three Scenarios include Combination 
Artifacts). The Story advances during each Scenario through frequent 
Text pop-ups. There are also Movies for every Scenario, instead of 
just one per Campaign. In keeping with the Plot, the early Scenarios 
have only Stronghold and Fortress Towns, with Castle and Tower 
Towns showing up later.<br>

<br>
Difficulty is selectable for every Scenario, and a Tutorial is 
included, so both Heroes Newcomers and Experts can play.
