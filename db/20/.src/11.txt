Heroes Chronicles is a Series of Turn-based Strategy Video Games 
developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and 
published by The 3DO Company. Each Installment of Chronicles was 
released as an Episode containing a relatively short single-player 
Campaign with a relatively low Difficulty Level. All Chronicles 
Games are based on a limited Version of the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III Game Engine. The Ability to play Scenario Maps and 
Multiplayer Games is not included in any Chronicles Title. 
Each Game (or Chapter) consists of a single Campaign recounting 
an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
Each Campaing is devoted to one Race of the Creatures of the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III Fanatasy Universe. <br>

<br>
Fifth Chapter -- The World Tree -- is devoted to 
Stronghold Game Race. <br>

<br>
Heroes Chronicles: The World Tree is the fifth in a Series of shorter, 
story-driven Games based on the Heroes of Might and Magic III: 
The Restoration of Erathia Engine. Each Game consists of a single Campaign 
recounting an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
This Chapter was released as a free Download for those who already owned 
two other Heroes Chronicles Games. <br>

<br>
One of the Ancestors, Vorr, has gone insane and is seeking to destroy 
the World Tree, the Essence of Life. It is now Tarnum's Task to gather up 
Forces and prevent Vorr from succeeding in his Plan. <br>

Unlike the other Entries in the Series (with the Exception of The Fiery Moon), 
this Chapter only has a five Scenario Campaign and does not include a Tutorial.
