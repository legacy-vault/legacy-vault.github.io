Heroes Chronicles is a Series of Turn-based Strategy Video Games 
developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and 
published by The 3DO Company. Each Installment of Chronicles was 
released as an Episode containing a relatively short single-player 
Campaign with a relatively low Difficulty Level. All Chronicles 
Games are based on a limited Version of the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III Game Engine. The Ability to play Scenario Maps and 
Multiplayer Games is not included in any Chronicles Title. 
Each Game (or Chapter) consists of a single Campaign recounting 
an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
Each Campaing is devoted to one Race of the Creatures of the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III Fanatasy Universe. <br>

<br>
The Final Part of Heroes Chronicles consists of two Chapters-Campaigns: 
Revolt of the Beastmasters and The Sword of Frost. <br>

<br>
Seventh Chapter -- Revolt of the Beastmasters -- is devoted to 
Fortress Game Race. <br>

<br>
Eighth Chapter -- The Sword of Frost -- is devoted to 
Dungeon Game Race. <br>

<br>
In the Revolt of the Beastmasters Tarnum frees the enslaved Swamp 
Dwellers and leads them to Freedom. The Swamp Dwellers are a Group 
of Creatures, which Tarnum has enslaved himself, back in his old 
Days when he was one of the Warlords of the Wastelands. <br>

<br>
In The Sword of Frost the elven Hero Gelu searches for the Sword of Frost, 
even he has been warned that this Blade may destroy the World, like the 
Armageddon's Blade. Tarnum's Task is to stop Gelu, but the only Creatures 
willing the Fight with the elven Hero are the evil Dungeon Dwellers of Nighon. <br>

<br>
The Games use the same Graphic Engine which was introduced first in the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia Game.
