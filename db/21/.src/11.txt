Heroes Chronicles is a Series of Turn-based Strategy Video Games 
developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and 
published by The 3DO Company. Each Installment of Chronicles was 
released as an Episode containing a relatively short single-player 
Campaign with a relatively low Difficulty Level. All Chronicles 
Games are based on a limited Version of the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III Game Engine. The Ability to play Scenario Maps and 
Multiplayer Games is not included in any Chronicles Title. 
Each Game (or Chapter) consists of a single Campaign recounting 
an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
Each Campaing is devoted to one Race of the Creatures of the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III Fanatasy Universe. <br>

<br>
Sixth Chapter -- The Fiery Moon -- is devoted to 
Stronghold Game Race. <br>

<br>
Heroes Chronicles: The Fiery Moon is the sixth in a Series of shorter, 
story-driven Games based on the Heroes of Might and Magic III: The 
Restoration of Erathia Engine. Each Game consists of a single 
Campaign recounting an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the 
immortal Hero. This Chapter was released as a free Download for those 
who already owned three other Heroes Chronicles Games. <br>

<br>
This Chapter is a direct Sequel to Heroes Chronicles: The World Tree. 
After saving the World Tree, the insane Ancestor Vorr managed to escape. 
Tarnum now has to locate Vorr and destroy him at any Cost. <br>

<br>
Unlike the other Entries in the Series (with the Exception of 
The World Tree), this Chapter only has a five Scenario Campaign and 
does not include a Tutorial.
