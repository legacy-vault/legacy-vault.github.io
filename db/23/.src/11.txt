Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented Operating System developed by Microsoft. 
It was a significant Improvement over the Company's previous DOS-based Windows Products. 
Windows 95 offered, at long last, a well designed document-oriented Desktop Shell 
that worked much like the 1984 Macintosh Finder. It also included a new Way of 
finding installed Applications through a "Start" Menu. And it included the same networking 
Abilities as Windows for Workgroups. <br>

<br>
It integrated the Ability to run 32-bit Applications similar to Windows NT or Windows 3.1 
with Win32s. It no longer ran on a Separate DOS Product. But Windows 95 was not a pure 
"32-bit" OS: It was still based around the Framework of Windows 3.x, 2.x and 1.x. 
It still ran on top of DOS, but bundled its own special "Windows 95" DOS 
(also known as MS-DOS 7). It could even still make Use of DOS Drivers! <br>

<br>
Windows 95 was designed to be maximally compatible with existing MS-DOS and 16-bit 
Windows Programs and Device Drivers, while offering a more stable and better performing 
System. Windows 95 Architecture is an Evolution of Windows for Workgroups' 386 enhanced Mode. 
The lowest Level of the Operating System consists of a large Number of virtual Device Drivers 
(VxDs) running in 32-bit protected Mode and one or more virtual DOS Machines running in 
virtual 8086 Mode. The virtual Device Drivers are responsible for handling physical Devices 
(such as Video and Network Cards), emulating virtual Devices used by the virtual Machines, 
or providing various System Services. The three most important virtual Device Drivers are: 
Virtual Machine Manager (VMM32.VXD), Configuration Manager (CONFIGMG) and 
Installable File System Manager (Input/Output Subsystem).
