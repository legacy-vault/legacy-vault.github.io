The Gameplay is very similar to its Predecessors in that the Player controls a Number of Heroes 
that command an Army of Creatures inspired by Myth and Legend. 
The Gameplay is divided into two Parts: tactical Overland Exploration and a Turn based Combat System. 
The Player creates an Army by spending Resources at one of the eight Town Types in the Game. 
The Hero will progress in Experience by engaging in Combat with enemy Heroes and Monsters. 
The Conditions for Victory vary depending on the Map, including Conquest of all Enemies and Towns, 
Collection of a Certain amount of a Resource, or finding the Grail Artifact. <br>

This is the first Release of HoMM III with no Copy Protection yet. Only this Version of Game has 
2 Sets of Cutscene Movie Files: Smack (low Quality) and Bink (high Quality). 
In all later Versions of HoMM III all such Movies except Intros and Endings are only in Smack Format, 
making "Video Quality" Option worthless.
