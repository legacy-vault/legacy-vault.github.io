Heroes Chronicles is a Series of Turn-based Strategy Video Games 
developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and 
published by The 3DO Company. Each Installment of Chronicles was 
released as an Episode containing a relatively short single-player 
Campaign with a relatively low Difficulty Level. All Chronicles 
Games are based on a limited Version of the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III Game Engine. The Ability to play Scenario Maps and 
Multiplayer Games is not included in any Chronicles Title. 
Each Game (or Chapter) consists of a single Campaign recounting 
an important Period in the Life of Tarnum, the immortal Hero. 
Each Campaing is devoted to one Race of the Creatures of the 
Heroes of Might and Magic III Fanatasy Universe. <br>

<br>
Second Chapter -- Conquest of the Underworld -- is devoted to 
Castle Game Race. <br>

<br>
Heroes Chronicles: Conquest of the Underworld is the second in a 
Series of shorter, story-driven Games based on the Heroes of Might and 
Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia Engine. This Installment 
follows the Quest of Tarnum, the Immortal Hero, escorting the Soul 
of a dead King through the Underworld, fighting all the Way, 
in Order to regain Paradise... <br>

<br>
The standard Heroes Gameplay is all here. Fantastical Creatures with 
special Abilities in Turn-based Battles over special Maps. Build 
Structures to recruit better Creatures, cast Spells to aid them in 
Combat, and more.
